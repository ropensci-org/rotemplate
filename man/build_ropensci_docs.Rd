build_ropensci_docs(
  path = ".",

  install = FALSE,
  preview = interactive(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{path to package source directory}

\item{destination}{path where to save the docs website}

\item{install}{passed to [pkgdown::build_site]. Default is to _not_ reinstall the package.}

\item{preview}{preview the website (servr will be used)}

\item{...}{passed to [pkgdown::build_site]}
}
\description{
Wrapper for [pkgdown::build_site] that we use to build the websites
for `https://docs.ropensci.org`. Sets a theme and logo, checks if
mathjax is required, and injects a logo into the readme if needed.
}
\details{
Note the default behavior is to render the docs using the installed
package, i.e. not reinstall the package on the fly (which does not
always work well). In production, we manually install the package
before running `build_ro_site`.
